# CKMR_ABC
Code to implement analyses for paper on simulation-based inference for CKMR models

SIMULATION STUDY 1
is run using /inst/sim_study_one_sample.R

SIMULATION STUDY 2
is run using /inst/sim_study_trend.R
This study also relies on some templated C++ code to run pseudo-likelihood models with (via R's TMB package).  

SIMULATION STUDY 3
is run using /inst/sim_monogamous_abc.R

CARIBOU ANALYSIS is run using inst/caribou_analysis.R, relying on data/caribou.csv
